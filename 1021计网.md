## Chap 3.4  RDT

### RDT  1.0-3.0

上节课讲到 RDT 1.0 - 3.0

最后一点关于 RDT 的就是 timeout 的设置

-   太长的话极其浪费时间
-   太短的话包还没送到就超时了

RDT 3.0 is **reliable**, but not fast, cuz you have to wait for the packets, and you only send 1 packet in a single RTT, (四舍五入就是 wasted)

### Pipelined protocols

#### Go back N

-   No buffer
-   Cumulative ACK
    -   ACK[n] = packet[0] - packet[n] ACK
-   If a packet timeout, the sender goes through a rollback
-   Resend all packets on loss or error
-   Use **transmit window** to keep track
    -   At most \<window size\> packets in flight
    -   window moves when **any** packet gets an ACK
    -   (aka **all packets before that** are correctly received)
    -   resends everything in window when there's error / timeout
-   FSM (check slides)

#### Selective Repeat

-   receiver has buffer, eventual in order delivery to upper layer
-   Individual ACK
    -   ACK[n] = packet[n] ACK
-   Has timer for each individual packet
-   Only retransmit packet that doesn't get an ACK
-   window
    -   sender: must wait until first x packets get ACKed
    -   receiver: (yup, there's a receiver window in SR) keep track of which packets are ACKed, which are still waiting
    -   Sequence # syncing issue
        -   If window has overlapping, receiver would take resend as a new packet
        -   TLDR: sequence # must be long enough (but not so long that it takes up half the packet)

#### Comparisons

Send side:

-   Data from above
-   timeout[n]
-   ACK[n]

Receive side:

-   packet[n]
-   what to resend
-   deliver

## Chap 3.5 TCP

RFCs: 793,1122,1323, 2018, 2581

Everything above are just principles for data transfer, not actual TCP...

### reliable, in order byte stream

-   sequence and ACK # are in unit of byte, not packet
-   sequence # = byte stream “number” of first byte in segment’s data
-   ACK # = byte stream “number” of expected next byte
-   If the current packet has x bytes, next # would be ACK[i + x], instead of ACK[i + 1]
-   cumulative ACKs
-   In bidirectional data transfer, the ACK is enclosed along while sending another packet
-   Out of order segments up to receiver
-   check slides: echo example, sequence # example

### RTT & timeout

too hungry for notes()
