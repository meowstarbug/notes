Digital logic 0904

    Not teaching you how to build computers
    but teaching basic components
    6-7 lab asignments
    (hmm seems like the project last year is just because there isn't enough assignments)

    (R U rlly taking this srsly?)
    (hmm I could...There aren't a lot of all eng courses...)

    Von neumann architecture:
        "this is what computers should look like"
        - single memory for data instructions
        - memory addressible regardless of content
        - one ins after another

        However there are other architectures...such as harvard architecture (as 黄朝星 said)(sorry 'bout the project, bro...)

        bottleneck: single bus of data
        (harvard has two busses)

        keep in mind that even though most modern computers are stuck with this architecture, this is NOT the only way to design computers...

    I guess I'll have a lot of "Digital circuits" and "Computer Organization" stuff...

    btw georgios 的课坐前排跟后排真的完全不一样...以及georgios 是讲的真的好，真实良心...我当年都干什么了去啊（扶额）
